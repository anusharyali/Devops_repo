Stash is an temporary storage location for storing the git changes.

eg: * Task-1: We are working on one feature -> Middle of the work -> Few changes are in working directory and staging area.
        eg: feature/security-work

    * Task-2: Urgent request for production bug fix -> fix in  next 1 hour  
        eg: master -> create new hotfix/deploy-failure


    * challenge : Git doesn't allow to switch branches where changes are not committed.
                  Git recommends either you rollback the changes or commit the changes.


  That is where stash comes into picture in these kind of scenarios where it will storage all the changes of  working directory and staging area into temporary location.
